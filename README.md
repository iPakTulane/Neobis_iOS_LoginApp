## Overview
The Neobis iOS LoginApp is a simple, yet powerful single-view application designed to demonstrate the implementation of a login functionality. This project serves as a foundation for integrating user authentication into your iOS applications. It's a great starting point for anyone looking to build apps that require user login and authentication.

## How to use the app
- Initially, a user will be presented with a login screen for authentication.
- The user needs to enter her credentials (name and password) into respective fields.
- After entering credentials, the user taps the "Log In" button to submit her login information.
- If login information is correct, the user will be granted access to her account or the associated services. Otherwise, she will receive an error message indicating that her credentials are incorrect.
